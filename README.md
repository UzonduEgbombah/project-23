## Persisting Data in Kubernetes

#### NOTE:
#### Create EKS cluster first before the below section
Now we know that containers are stateless by design, which means that data does not persist in the containers. Even when you run the containers in kubernetes pods, they still remain stateless unless you ensure that your configuration supports statefulness.
To achieve statefuleness in kubernetes, you must understand how volumes, persistent volumes, and persistent volume claims work.

#### Volumes
On-disk files in a container are ephemeral, which presents some problems for non-trivial applications when running in containers. One problem is the loss of files when a container crashes. The kubelet restarts the container but with a clean state. A second problem occurs when sharing files between containers running together in a Pod. The Kubernetes volume abstraction solves both of these problems
Docker has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. A Docker volume is a directory on disk or in another container. Docker provides volume drivers, but the functionality is somewhat limited.
Kubernetes supports many types of volumes. A Pod can use any number of volume types simultaneously. Ephemeral volume types have a lifetime of a pod, but persistent volumes exist beyond the lifetime of a pod. When a pod ceases to exist, Kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes; however, Kubernetes does not destroy persistent volumes. For any kind of volume in a given pod, data is preserved across container restarts.
At its core, a volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the containers in a pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are all determined by the particular volume type used. This means, you must know some of the different types of volumes available in kubernetes before choosing what is ideal for your particular use case.
Lets have a look at a few of them.

#### awsElasticBlockStore
An awsElasticBlockStore volume mounts an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EBS volume into your pod. The contents of an EBS volume are persisted and the volume is only unmmounted when the pod crashes, or terminates. This means that an EBS volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can be shared between pods.
Lets see what it looks like for our Nginx pod to persist data using awsElasticBlockStore volume

sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumes:
      - name: nginx-volume
        # This AWS EBS volume must already exist.
        awsElasticBlockStore:
          volumeID: "<volume id>"
          fsType: ext4
EOF


The volume section indicates the type of volume to be used to ensure persistence.
If you notice the config above carefully, you will realise that there is need to provide a volumeID before the deployment will work. Therefore, You must create an EBS volume by using aws ec2 create-volume command or the AWS console.
Before you create a volume, lets run the nginx deployment into kubernetes without a volume.

sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF


Tasks

Verify that the pod is running
Check the logs of the pod
Exec into the pod and navigate to the nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/conf.d

Open the config files to see the default configuration.
